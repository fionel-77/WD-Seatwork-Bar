    <p class="description">
    Prismatic Pearl started with three friends who one day decided that they
    would come together to create the special safe space they dreamed of when they
    were still fresh out of college. A place where you can be your most authentic self
    without having to worry about the judgement of others. Anyone can be the life of the party and
    we make sure no one will feel left out. Prismatic Pearl is here to offer comfortability, solidarity,
    exciting shows and of course, very fun drinks that's sure to knock your socks off. Join us for the fun!
